# TCPP Client Downloader
Downloads a client from Blizzard's servers and patches it such that it works with the The-Cataclysm-Preservation-Project (TCPP) servers.

## Usage
During the installation it will ask you what kind of client you want to install. 
Use the `enUS` version! Otherwise you have to edit the locale in `WTF/Config.wtf`.
Run it on your own risk!

### GNU/Linux & Mac
1. Make sure that `wine` is installed.
2. Make sure that `wine`'s environment folder is located in `~/.wine`.
3. Run `bash ClientCreator.sh`

### Windows 10
1. Run `ClientCreator.ps1` with the `PowerShell`.
